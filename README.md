# PyRI Open Source Teach Pendant Program Master

This package is part of the PyRI project. See https://github.com/pyri-project/pyri-core#documentation for documentation. This package is included in the `pyri-robotics-superpack` Conda package.

The `pyri-program-master` package contains the program master service which executes the top-level program state machine.

## Service

This service is started automatically by `pyri-core`, and does not normally need to be started manually.

Standalone service command line example:

```
pyri-program-master-service
```

The `pyri-variable-storage` and `pyri-device-manager` services must be running before use.

Command line options:

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
| ---    | ---  | ---      | ---         |
| `--device-manager-url=` | Robot Raconteur URL | No | Robot Raconteur URL of device manager service |
| `--device-manager-identifier=` | Identifier | No | Robot Raconteur device identifier in string format for device manager service |
| `--device-info-file=` | File | No | Robot Raconteur `DeviceInfo` YAML file. Defaults to contents of `pyri_program_master_default_info.yml` |

This service may use any standard `--robotraconteur-*` service node options.

This service uses the `DeviceManagerClient`, which needs to connect to the device manager service to find other devices. This can be done using discovery based on a Robot Raconteur device identifier, or using a specified Robot Raconteur URL. If neither is specified, the `DeviceManagerClient` will search for the identifier named `pyri_device_manager` on the local machine.
